    <h4>0.70.0 Released</h4>
    <p>This is a very small release and I probably could've just waited longer
    until there were more changes worth releasing, but I think it's good to have
    a reliable release cycle and we've been doing two-month releases for awhile now.
    Of course I rushed out 0.68.1 a little more than a month ago and we've only had
    two changes since then.  So I do 0.xx.0 releases every two months and 0.xx.1 releases
    when needed.  It makes sense to me at least.  Anyway, these are the only changes between
    0.68.1 and 0.70.0:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Fixed behavior when one custom mapping is a subset of another custom mapping</li>
		<li>Fixed behavior in subword text object plugin when cursor is on word boundary</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.68.1 Released</h4>
    <p>We had a regression in the 0.68.0 release and I debated whether it was
    critical enough to release a 0.68.1 to fix it.  The defect isn't major but
    it's in a common enough feature ('*' and '#') that a lot of people have
    noticed it. Given that Eclipse Neon was just released, I'm guessing a lot of
    people will be re-installing the current stable build of Vrapper with it.  I
    figured it's best to have a solid release for those people.  So here's a
    quick release with a couple issues we've fixed in the last month.  They are:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>Fixed regression where '*' and '#' behaved like 'g*' and 'g#'</li>
		<li>Fixed stupid mistake which prevented you from setting &lt;leader&gt; in .vrapperrc</li>
		<li>Fixed issue with Vrapper resetting an Eclipse selection when using 'select all'</li>
		<li>Fixed regression which broke the ':set &lt;option&gt;?' feature to display value</li>
		<li>Changed cycle plugin so cursor stays at beginning of changed word</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.68.0 Released</h4>
    <p>I was able to find some time this month to work on new Vrapper features, including
    some plugin requests that have been sitting around for a while.  Of course, this project
    is so mature now that we're looking at the more obscure features in Vim but all of
    these were requested by users filing Issues on our GitHub page.  We hope you continue to enjoy
    Vrapper!</p>

    <h4>0.64.0 Released</h4>
    
    <p>This new release of Vrapper only has a couple defect fixes but they're
    important fixes.  One defect could create an infinite re-paint loop
    (crashing Eclipse) and another broke Vrapper in older (< 3.7) versions of
    Eclipse.  Both of those defects are fixed!</p>
    
    <ul>
		<li>Fixed issue causing an infinite loop when performing an Eclipse refactor</li>
		<li>Fixed issue preventing Vrapper from working in older versions of Eclipse (< 3.7)</li>
		<li>Fixed issue where confirm substitution wouldn't open folds</li>
		<li>Fixed issue where setting register contents with 'let @' wouldn't allow '=' character</li>
		<li>Fixed issue with entering search mode on the last line of a file when that line is empty</li>
    </ul>

    refactoring to cleanup the code and fix certain little annoyances.
    Hope everyone enjoys this new release!</p>

		<li>Added support for 'o' and 'O' in visual block mode</li>

    <h4>0.60.0 Released</h4>
    
    <p>It's been another two months so I'm releasing our current changes.
    Development is still moving slowly, but it's moving forward.  Albertdev did
    a bunch of refactoring to clean up some code under the hood.  The work
    wasn't related to any specific defect but a lot of the commands should be
    more stable.  Here are the changes I can describe:</p>
    
    <ul>
		<li>Added support for 'wrapscan' setting</li>
		<li>We now determine certain default values based on Eclipse settings</li>
			<ul><li>tabstop, expandtab, newline type, etc.</li></ul>
		<li>Fixed intermittent display issue with dark themes</li>
		<li>Fixed issue with 'gq' counting a tab character as one column</li>
		<li>Massive refactoring of many line-based and :ex commands</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.58.0 Released</h4>

    <p>Development for Vrapper is slowing to a halt.  We're all too busy to find
    the time to make enhancements anymore.  I apologize to all of you who have
    been filing new enhancement requests which we've been ignoring.  Hopefully
    we'll find the time to implement some of them here and there.  However,
    Vrapper is stable and has lots of features so I'm hoping most users are
    happy with the current state of things.</p>
    <p>With all that said, there were some fixes in the last couple months so
    I'm releasing another new version.  Here are the changes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed issue where :g command with 'normal' wouldn't return to normal mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with :g command and 'normal' inserting newlines</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'o' and 'cleanindent' at the end of a file</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with 'A-O' from insert mode not returning to insert mode</li>
        <li>Fixed issue where selecting text within a fold didn't open the fold</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with mouse-selections going over a fold</li>
        <li>Fixed display of mode and recording status when using Eclipse's dark themes</li>
        <li>Fixed selection highlighting when using 'c'onfirm flag for substitutions</li>
        <li>Fixed performance issue with search highlighting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Thank you to all the users who have used and enjoyed Vrapper throughout the years!</p>
